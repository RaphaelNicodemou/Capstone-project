NYU Stern School of Business invites every semester professors from around the world to teach some of its lessons. The directors of the school want to offer the visiting professors the option of free meals during the weekdays as a welcoming gesture and to help them adjust faster to New York's lifestyle. They want to find the 3 best restaurants around the school. They also want the restaurants to be at a close distance so the professors can go there even if they have little time between the classes. The Foursquare ratings are very important to ensure the best quality of the restaurants as NYU Stern School of Business wants to make sure that it offers the best to its professors.
We will use Foursquare location data to provide to the school directory the best restaurants based on Foursquare ratings that are in a predefined radius from the school.
